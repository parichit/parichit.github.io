:bowtie: I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science (minor in Data Science) at [Luddy School of Informatics, Computing & Engineering](https://luddy.indiana.edu/index.html). Prior to PhD, I earned M.S. in Computer Science from IU, Bloomington. I study and stay in the beautiful flagship campus of IU-home of Hoosiers. 

I am interested in Data-centric AI, Data Mining (optimized algorithms for large data), Large Language Models (LLMs), Efficient and Sustainable AI and Bioinformatics.

Prior to school, I gained diverse experience across industry, research labs and academia. Some relatively recent examples are: Bioinformatics Intern at [Ancestry](https://www.ancestry.com/corporate), where I developed community annotation tools and Machine Learning based recommendation features, and as a participant in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) program with the Python Software Foundation, where I contributed to the development of workflows for neuro-image data processing and analysis. Science-wise, I have worked with and gave consulting to domain scientists in computational structural biology and agricultural genomics.
